# Cryptography

## Differences between encryption and encoding.

## Symmetric / asymmetric encryption

## Encryption algorithms:
### - DES
- Symetric Block Cipher
### - 3DES
- Symetric Block Cipher
### - AES
- Symetric Block Cipher
### - RSA
- RSA is an assymetric encyption algorithm, which uses a public / private key pair.
### - RC4
Is a stream encryption cipher.
## Hashes
Hashes are one way functions. They are used to provide integrity, 
### - SHA1
### - MD5

## Message Integrity codes:
### - HMAC
