# X11

## X Windows security and configuration; host-based vs. user-based access control.

## Host-based access control
- A host-based mechanism is a general-purpose mechanism. This type of mechanism enables you to give access to a particular host, in which all users on that host can connect to the server. A host-based mechanism is a weaker form of access control. If the host has access to the server, all users on that host are allowed to connect to the server.

The Solaris environment provides the host-based mechanism for backward compatibility.

## User-based access control

- A user-based, or authorization-based, mechanism allows you to give access explicitly to a particular user on any host machine. The user's client passes authorization data to the server. If the data match the server's authorization data, the user is allowed access.
