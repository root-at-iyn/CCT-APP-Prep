# Record Keeping, Interim Reporting & Final Results

## Understanding reporting requirements

- **Agree on when the report will be delievered to the client.** This should be within a few days after the test has concluded.
- **Agree on how the report will be delivered** (email / file share / encrypted format)
- **Agree on the format of the report**. A typical report will have the following:
    - Provide a detailed technical report on the vulnerabilities of the system
    - Explain the vulnerabilities in a way that is understandable for senior management
    - Report the outcome of the test in business risk terms
    - Identify short term (tactical) recommendations
    - Conclude with and define ‘root cause’ long term (strategic) recommendations
    - Include a security improvement action plan
    - Provide assistance in implementing the security improvements

## Understanding the importance of accurate and structured record keeping during the engagement

- The outputs from testing should be stored safely by the test team and securely deleted when no longer required.
- The test data, scan logs and information pertaining to the attacks that were attempted as well as successful should be accurate and retained by the testing team. This is important to: 
    - Prove what items that were tested in any disputes, or to repudiate with proof any issues that occured during test that were not caused by the test team.
    - Prove the validity of any issues that were found during testing.
    - Confirmation of the test being limited to the targets in scope.
